    <div class="background-info">Mike Whitaker started in residential construction 35 years ago in the Tampa Bay area doing carpentry, custom track homes, and light commercial work, where later he expanded his work to include residential remodeling and renovations. His varied skills were useful in 1992 when Mike found himself in a position to help families repair and rebuild their homes in South Florida that were damaged by Hurricane Andrew. It was because of this experience that Mike started to develop a passion for timber-framed structures and so, he began attending classes and workshops in North Georgia and Western North Carolina. <br>
      <br>  Later in 1999, Mike and his wife, Michelle, decided to move their 3 daughters to Haywood County where they had purchased property several years earlier. By 2002, Mike had advanced to lead carpenter on several custom post-and-beam homes and by 2003, he was a superintendent on a large timber-frame structure in Haywood County. At the same time, Mike was also logging timbers from his property in Crabtree to build a custom home for his family. Upon completion of the family home in 2006, Mike established M. Whitaker Construction and continues to run the business today. His past and current projects include custom homes, fireplace pavilions, garages, bath and kitchen remodels, and construction of unique spaces (i.e., enclosed porches and livestock quarters). He also manages properties for a number of his clients.  <br>
      <br> Across all of his work, Mike considers the needs of his clients individually and creates a personalized experience to guarantee satisfaction. Please contact M. Whitaker Construction for your next renovation, repair, or new construction project.
