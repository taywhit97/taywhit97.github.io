        <div class="quotes"> "I met Mike almost 20 years ago as the company he had just gone to work for was finishing our home. Mike stood out above the other "existing" employees and I knew he would end up on his own. Soon after, Mike was indeed on his own and we were adding elements to our home along with the continual home maintenance. Mike has performed 100% of the work on our home through the years, but he is actually more than a small job contractor. Mike checks on our home periodically while we're gone, let's other vendors in, helps troubleshoot any and all items that may come up and has even turned into a trusted friend and mountain biking partner. Mike is truly a unique man that the world is becoming more and more void of these days. Someone you can trust with your home and vehicle (your mountain bike too). It is very comforting being 600 miles away and knowing Mike is available to help in what ever way possible on our home. He has my very highest recommendation. As a note, I own a general contracting firm in Florida, and would hire Mike in a heartbeat if he ever moved south!" <br> <br> - David L. Brandon </div>

        <div class="quotes"> "Mike, I would like to thank you for all of your hard work and effort to help make the Oliveri Family mountain home a reality. Your attitude toward the build of this home and your professionalism is second to none. Your attention to detail from beginning to end is much appreciated. As an architect, the fine details are of the upmost importance. Thank you for responding to my questions and requests in a timely manner. Thank your for working with me to help achieve my vision for this home. Blessings always!" <br> <br> - Joseph Oliveri </div>

        <div class="quotes"> "Mike Whitaker absolutely aced our master bathroom renovation. Mike was recommended to us by a neighbor, based on several jobs he'd accomplished already. Mike helped us plan changes in our kitchen and bathroom, steered us to the proper places to select materials (i.e., tile, countertops, fixtures, etc.), then started on the actual work based on our schedule. All work was accomplished on time, to an exceptionally high-quality standard of workmanship, all within the budget we expected. Best of all, we love the changes he suggested. The livability of our home has been enhanced 1000%. We're planning some future home improvements and will absolutely ask Mike to do the job." <br> <br> - John & Lynn Phillips</div>
